    "# 2.- Euler-Maruyama method\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have reviewed basic concepts about probability and sampling distributions using `numpy`, we can delve into the \n",
    "technical core of this project. The objective of this notebook is to introduce the Euler-Maruyama (EM) method to numerically solve a Stochastic differential equation (SDE). Before presenting the numerical method, we provide a brief explanation of what is an SDE and what are the main components. We then describe the Brownian motion and its relationship with Gaussian normal distributions. The Brownian motion is a essential building block to understand and solve SDEs. We conclude with the EM method and how to implement it using `numpy` functionalities."

    "\n",
    "An SDE is a mathematical equation describing the dynamics of a system or process subject to deterministic and random influences. It formulates the time-evolution equation of variables with inherent randomness. By seamlessly incorporating random terms, SDEs offer a powerful framework for analysing and understanding random variable behaviour. As a result, they find wide-ranging applicability in fields such as biology, finance and physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are different types of SDEs, we restrict our attention to the following type of SDE, so-called It√¥ SDE. Considering that $X_t$ represents the variable we are interested at time $t$, its related SDE is written in the form of:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "dX_{t} = \\mu(X_t, t)dt + \\sigma(X_t, t) dW_t.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we explain each component of the equation above.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $dX_t$ is the differential of $X_t$, i.e., a small (infinitesimal) change of $X_t$. \n",
    "* $\\mu(X_t, t)dt$ is the drift term. It represents the deterministic force driving the expected or average rate of change in $X_t$ at time $t$. In general, the drift coefficient $\\mu(\\cdot)$ can be a function of the process value $X_t$ and the time step $t$ as represented here or it can be a constant, $\\mu(X_t, t) = \\mu$. $dt$ represents the differential of time. As we will see later, this term informs about the trend behaviour of $X$ over time.\n",
    "* $\\sigma(X_t, t)dW_t$ is the diffusion term. It represents the stochastic part of the equation, introducing the random behaviour. The term $\\sigma(X_t, t)$ is called the diffusion coefficient and it is inherently related to the volatility or uncertainty evolution of the variable $X_t$ at time $t$. Like the drift coefficient, the diffusion coefficient can be a function of the process value $X_t$ and be time-dependent $t$ or it can be a constant $\\sigma(X_t, t) = \\sigma$. $dW_t$ is a Wiener process, so-called Brownian motion. It involves the random fluctuation of the variable $X$ injecting random noise in the time-evolution equation. We will provide a detailed explanation of the Brownian motion and its implications in the next subsection. Now, we can think of the Brownian motion as a noise generator that follows a Gaussian distribution $W_t \\sim \\mathcal{N(0, t)}$.\n"
